# Introduction
This project was inspired by:
* https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort
* https://github.com/Ma-Dan/keras-yolo4
* https://github.com/Qidian213/deep_sort_yolov3

I swapped out YOLO v3 for YOLO v4 and added the option for asynchronous processing, which significantly improves
the FPS. However, FPS monitoring is disabled when asynchronous processing is used since it isn't accurate.

## Low confidence track filtering

Navigate to the appropriate folder to use low confidence track filtering. The above video demonstrates the difference.

I took the algorithm from this ![paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337541842_Vehicle_Tracking_Using_Deep_SORT_with_Low_Confidence_Track_Filtering) and implemented it into deep_sort/track.py. This reduces tracking false positives by calculating the average detection confidence over a set number of detections before a track is initiated. The average detection threshold (`adc_threshold`) and the number of detections (`n_init`) can be changed in deep_sort/tracker.py.

## With asynchronous processing
![](gifs/async_example.gif)

As you can see in the gif, asynchronous processing has better FPS but causes stuttering.

This code only detects and tracks people, but can be changed to detect other objects by changing lines 103 in yolo.py. For example, to detect people and cars, change
```
if predicted_class != 'person':
    continue
```
to
```
if predicted_class not in ('person', 'car'):
    continue
```

Please note that Deep SORT is only trained on tracking people, so you'd need to train a model yourself for tracking other objects.
See https://github.com/nwojke/cosine_metric_learning.

## Performance
Real-time FPS with video writing:
* ~4.3fps with YOLO v3
* ~10.6fps with YOLO v4

Turning off tracking gave ~12.5fps with YOLO v4.

YOLO v4 performs much faster and appears to be more stable than YOLO v3. All tests were done using an Nvidia GTX 1070 8gb GPU
 and an i7-8700k CPU.

# Quick start
[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT) and convert the Darknet YOLO v4 model  to a Keras model by modifying convert.py accordingly and run:
```
python convert.py
```
Then run demo.py:
```
python demo.py
```

## Settings
By default, tracking and video writing is on and asynchronous processing is off. These can be edited in demo.py by changing:
```
tracking = True
writeVideo_flag = True
asyncVideo_flag = False
```

To change target file in demo.py:
```
file_path = 'video.webm'
```

To change output settings in demo.py:
```
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output_yolov4.avi', fourcc, 30, (w, h))
```
